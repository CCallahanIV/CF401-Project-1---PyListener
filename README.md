# CF401-Project-1: PyListener

This is the repository for our team's group project 1 in Code Fellow's 401 Python class .

Members of this project are:
 * Ted Callahan
 * Maelle Vance
 * Rick Valenzuela

The purpose of this project is to create a visual communication tool in the form of a web-based app intended for use on mobile platforms to assist users with communication disabilities.
Instances include users with a communication disability such as Apraxia, a motor disorder in which the patient is unable to perform certain tasks or movements despite full understanding and willingness. In [Apraxia of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apraxia_of_speech), patients have difficulty conveying ideas and thoughts from the brain to the spoken words. Apraxia of speech can manifest itself after incidents such as a stroke or trauma.


# User Stories

The primary users of the app are the end user and an administrator. Use-case examples include:


As a child with Apraxia I want a simple communication tool to help me communicate with my parents and other adults I commonly interact with (e.g. teachers).


As a stroke victim with Apraxia I want a simple communication tool to help me communicate with caregivers and family by means of written text, email messages, or SMS.


As a parent or guardian of a child with Apraxia, I want a communication tool I can configure to enable my child to better communicate their needs, wants, and feelings to me directly or remotely.


As a family member of an adult with Apraxia, I want a communication tool I can configure to enable my loved one to communicate their needs, wants, and feelings to me directly or remotely.


As a professional caregiver of an adult with Apraxia, I want a communication tool I can configure to enable my patient to communicate their medical and personal needs and wants to me directly or remotely.
